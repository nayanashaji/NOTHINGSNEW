# NOTHINGSNEW
It is a typing test where the text keeps changing, making it intentionally frustrating and annoying for the users. 
A user can select the time limit, just like an ordinary typing test, but what comes next isn’t so ordinary1
Imagine yourself typing the words, so focused, but the moment you look up-BOOM!
The words have already changed to something soo random that you couldn’t even have imagined it happening. Frustrated, you correct your word and start typing again and there you go- the words have messed up again! 
But now  there’s no time to feel annoyed because the timer is going to end in a matter of seconds and all that’s left to do is for you to sit and sulk in a corner.
